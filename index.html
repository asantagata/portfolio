                    <p>Alex Santagata (/sæntəˈɡɒtə/, san-tə-GAHT-ə; born February 25, 2004) is an American web developer. He is a senior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where he studies software engineering, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing (HPC.)</p>
                    <p>Primarily a front-end developer, Alex's work focuses on combining beautiful user interfacing with significant functionality. With over ten years of experience writing code for the web, he has developed mastery over React, JavaScript, and plain old HTML. Alex is proficient in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the following languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Java, C++, Python;</li>
                        <li>the following frameworks and libraries: React, Node.js, Express, Socket.IO (WebSockets), Prisma ORM, Sequelize;</li>
                        <li>and the following platforms and utilities: Git, Trello, Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, Oracle DBM, PostgreSQL.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Alex is currently working with a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to develop PerfFlowAspect, an LLVM-based profiling tool for HPC programs in C and Python based on aspect-oriented programming. Alex is working on various features for PFA, including porting the project to later versions of the Clang compiler and creating benchmark workflows.</p>
                    <p>As a member of Mosaiq Software, Alex's recent work includes Card Domain, a real-time multiplayer card gaming platform with a rich suite of features including editing for card decks. Alex developed the front- and back-end architecture of Card Domain over the summer of 2025, utilizing WebSockets and Sequelize for real-time and persistent interactions. He also contributed to the development of Terrazzo, an online application for kanban-style list-making. Terrazzo includes an impressive breadth of features such as live WebSockets-based user interactions and an extensive in-house markdown system which Alex developed.</p>
                    <p>Some of Alex's notable academic work is his significant contribution to the prototypical Brigham & Women's Hospital web app, developed in a team of ten engineers over the course of spring 2025. In addition to managing the team with Agile methodologies, Alex designed crucial features such as the navigation system and editor for the hospital floor plan, messaging and broadcasting systems, and voice command processing. Other courses of interest include Machine Learning, Analysis of Algorithms, and Theory of Computation.</p>
                    <p>Alex's work also extends beyond the contiguous United States. Over the fall of 2024, Alex worked alongside a team of engineers and the Department of Public Works of Nantucket, Massachusetts, to develop, populate and analyze a database and GIS layer describing Nantucket's town-owned trees.</p>
                    <p>Alex has also tutored in programming, mathematics and physics for several years. On top of his expertise in traditional web development technologies, he has a passion for language processing and related theory, and enjoys teaching and integrating these into his methodologies for web development.</p>
                    <p>Outside of the field of computing, Alex is passionate about tabletop games, which inspired several of his software projects. He also enjoys hiking and is fascinated by puzzle games such as those in Simon Tatham's puzzle collection.</p>
                    <p>Driven by a need to learn continually and develop great software, Alex strives to create web-based tools that are not only functional but transformative for their users.</p>
